# Bluetooth-Headphones-Keeper-Upper-Service
A service that prevents Bluetooth headphones from shutting off.

Some of the cheaper Bluetooth headphones will cut off the beginning of the sound, if said sound happens after a bout of silence.
Some may also have a hearable difference for sound being off and sound being on, which can be annoying.

This prevents both of these issues by simply playing a silent looping sound in the background. It's a service, so it
will start automatically whenever you turn on your computer.

Note: This might lower your headphones' battery life.

## Installation

Simply unzip the archive somewhere and run "Install.bat". You will be asked for admin privileges.
Files will be copied to /Program Files(x86)/BluetoothKeeperService and installed from there.

To uninstall, simply run "Uninstall.bat".
